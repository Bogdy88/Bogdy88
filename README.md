DevSecOps Showcase

This repository is a collection of my DevSecOps practices and showcases how I integrate development, security, and operations into a seamless and secure pipeline. Each section demonstrates different aspects of the DevSecOps lifecycle, including CI/CD automation, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), vulnerability scanning, and monitoring.

Overview

DevSecOps is about integrating security into every stage of the development pipeline. In this repository, I showcase several tools, techniques, and practices that automate and secure the software development lifecycle (SDLC). The main focus areas include:

    Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) automation
    Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for provisioning and managing resources
    Security testing and vulnerability scanning in the pipeline
    Logging, monitoring, and incident response

CI/CD Pipelines

In this section, you’ll find examples of CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions, including steps for:

    Build: Compiling or preparing your application for deployment
    Test: Running unit tests or security checks
    Deploy: Automatically deploying to environments like staging or production

See the ci_cd/github-actions.yml file for a simple GitHub Actions workflow.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

This section demonstrates how I use Terraform and Ansible to automate the provisioning and configuration of infrastructure. Examples include:

    Terraform: Cloud resource provisioning (e.g., AWS EC2, S3 buckets)
    Ansible: Automating server setup and configuration tasks

Check out the infrastructure-as-code/terraform/ and infrastructure-as-code/ansible/ directories for the relevant files.
Security

Security is integrated at every stage of the pipeline. In this section, I show how to perform security testing and monitoring using various tools:

    Vulnerability Scanning: Using tools like Trivy, OWASP ZAP, and Anchore to scan for security vulnerabilities.
    Logging and Monitoring: Setting up tools like ELK stack, Prometheus, and Grafana for real-time application monitoring and log aggregation.

Explore the security/vulnerability-scanning/ and security/logging-monitoring/ directories for more details.
Docs

This section contains detailed documentation on the DevSecOps practices I follow, including best practices, tool choices, and strategies. If you're new to DevSecOps, check out the DEVSECOPS_OVERVIEW.md document in this folder for an in-depth introduction.
